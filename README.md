# LADnet

This application is a simple pre-processing tool for GNSS baselines, point clusters generated from SINEX, and other geodetic measurements (TBC) arranged in a geodetic network. 

The input format is currently DynaML. This will be enhanced in a future version to encompass GeodesyML 0.2+.

The options can be found at the command prompt. Call `./LADNET` from a Linux/OSX terminal or `LADNET.exe` on a Windows command prompt to see all options.
